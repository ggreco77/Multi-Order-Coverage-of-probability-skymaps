# Multi-Order-Coverage-of-probability-skymaps

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/ggreco77/multi-order-coverage-of-probability-skymaps)

This document explains how gravitational wave sky maps can be easily and efficiently visualized and processed using Multi-Order Coverage (MOC) maps based on HEALPix sky tessellation. We compute the MOC region at a given probability level and subsequently, we simultaneously query databases for retrieving objects whose position falls within this MOC map. If databases are adapted to supporting MOC based queries, they will offer then a useful method allowing any kind of sky region query.
